Clean â€” a theme for Pelican
=====

**NOTE: CLEAN IS NO LONGER UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT, AS I AM FOCUSSING ON THE [BOHEMIAN PELICAN THEME](http://github.com/omphalosskeptic/bohemian).** (You can still fork it and use it and all that).

A minimalist theme for the Python static site generator [Pelican](http://getpelican.com). This is very much a work in progress. It works for my current purposes but has not been well tested. Expect some configuration time if you decide to use this theme.

## Clean in the Wild

- ~~[My GitHub Userpage](http://omphalosskeptic.github.com)~~ 
- ~~[Science Class](http://scienceclass.github.io)~~

Uses Pygments.css, Typeplate.css, and Reset.css. Based on default Pelican theme Simple, by Smashing Magazine.

Typeset in Linux Libertine.
