Clean â€” a theme for Pelican
=====

A minimalist theme for the Python static site generator [Pelican](http://getpelican.com). This is very much a work in progress. It works for my current purposes but has not been well tested. Expect some configuration time if you decide to use this theme.

## Clean in the Wild

- [My GitHub Userpage](http://omphalosskeptic.github.com)  
- [Science Class](http://scienceclass.github.io)

Uses Pygments.css, Typeplate.css, and Reset.css. Based on default Pelican theme Simple, by Smashing Magazine.

Typeset in Linux Libertine.
